# R Markdown
*[Ashkan Mirzaee](https://ashki23.github.io/index.html) - December 2018*

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) is a file format for making dynamic HTML documents with R Studio. An R Markdown document is written in Markdown and could contain chunks of embedded source codes, LaTeX formula and graphics. A basic knowledge about Markdown and LaTeX is required to create HTML documents by R Markdown. You may review a tutorial in [here](https://ashki23.github.io/markdown_latex.html) to learn more about Markdown and LaTeX. This tutorial only provides a quick reference of some R Markdown features.

## Code chunks
In R Markdown, we can evaluate source codes such as R and Python. For example we can display and run the following R codes by inserting ` ```{program} `. For example:

```markdown
` ``{r}
summary(cars$dist)
summary(cars$speed)
` ``
```

We can also run Python codes in R Markdown. To do that, first we need to install `reticulate` package. 

```markdown
` ``{python}
n = 5  
while n < 10:
    print(n)
    n += 1
else:
    print(n)
` ``
```

R Markdown can execute code in many languages besides R and Python. Some of the available language engines include:

- SQL
- Bash
- Rcpp
- Stan
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Markdown

You can find more details [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_knitr_engines.html%23sql).

Also, we can evaluate inline codes. For example, there were `r nrow(cars)` cars in the study.

```markdown
For example, there were `r nrow(cars)` cars in the study.
```

## Chunk options
Chunk output can be customized in R Markdown with arguments set in the `{}` of a chunk header.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = paste("Figure", 1:5, sep = " "), warning = FALSE}
plot(cars, main = "Main Title")
```

```markdown
` ``{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = paste("Figure", 1:5, sep = " "), warning = FALSE}
plot(cars, main = "Main Title")
` ``
```

Above, we used the following arguments:

- `echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures 
- `fig.align = "center"` center alignment of figures in the output document 
- `fig.cap = "..."` adds a caption to graphical results
- `warning = FALSE` prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished

Some other important arguments are:

- `eval`: whether to evaluate the code chunk
- `include`: whether to include the chunk output in the final output document
- `results`: takes one of `hold/hide/asis/markup` 
- `collapse`: collapse all the source and output blocks from one code chunk into a single block
- `out.width`: width and of the plot in the final output file (can be `"100%"` or less) 
- `fig.align`: one of `left, right` and `center`

## YAML header
At the top of the R Markdown document, we can insert the following to adjust the final output.

```markdown
---
title: "Page Title"
subtitle: "Page sub-title"
author: "[Ashkan Mirzaee](https://ashki23.github.io)"
description: "This is a test"
institute: "MU"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), "%d %B %Y")`"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: default/paper/lumen/cosmo/yeti/flatly/sandstone/darkly/cerulean/journal/readable
    highlight: default/pygments/haddock/kate/textmate/tango/monochrome/espresso/zenburn
    code_folding: show/hide
    toc: true/false
    toc_depth: 3
    number_sections: true/false
    toc_float:
      collapsed: true/false
      smooth_scroll: true/false
    include:
      in_header: header.html (your header file)
      before_body: script.html (your script file)
      after_body: footer.html (your footer file)
    css: styles.css (your css file)
    keep_md: TRUE
---
```

`keep_md: TRUE` in last line or add `github_document` to outputs keep a Markdown file to use in GitHub or GitLab repositories. You may learn more about R Markdown YAML header [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html).
